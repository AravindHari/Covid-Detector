# COVID-19-Detection-Flask-App-based-on-Chest-X-rays-and-CT-Scans
COVID-19 Detection based on Chest X-rays and CT Scans using four Transfer Learning algorithms: VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, Xception. The models were trained for 500 epochs on around 1000 Chest X-rays and around 750 CT Scan images on Google Colab GPU. After training, the accuracies acheived for the model are as follows:
